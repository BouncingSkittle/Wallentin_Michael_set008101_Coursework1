			<h3> 
				ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places") is a simple letter substitution cipher that 
				replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it, in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher, 
				developed in ancient Rome. <br>
				Because there are 26 letters (2×13) in the basic Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, 
				the same algorithm is applied, so the same action can be used for encoding and decoding. The algorithm provides 
				virtually no cryptographic security, and is often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption. <br>
				ROT13 is used in online forums as a means of hiding spoilers, punchlines, puzzle solutions, and offensive 
				materials from the casual glance. ROT13 has been described as the "Usenet equivalent of a magazine printing 
				the answer to a quiz upside down". ROT13 has inspired a variety of letter and word games on-line, and is 
				frequently mentioned in newsgroup conversations.
