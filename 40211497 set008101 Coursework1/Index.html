			<h2> Coursework Assignment </h2>
			<h3> Web Tech (SET08101) </h3>
			<h3> Overview </h3>
			<h3>
				The aim of this coursework is to design and implement a website consisting of a set
				of pages about classical ciphers. Your site must be implemented using HTML, CSS,
				& Javascript and make no use of additional libraries, templates or frameworks.
                Your site must include at least an index.html page, a design.html page, and one
				additional html page for each cipher that you implement in Javascript. You should
				decide on your own naming and organisational scheme for any additional html
				pages & any associated CSS, JavaScript, or other files required by your solution.
            </h3>
            <h3>
				index.html - This will be the default page that your visitors will see. From here
				your user must be able to navigate to the other pages in your site.
            </h3>
            <h3>
				design.html - This page is a design document page which will demonstrate all of
				the typographical and presentational elements used in your site.
            </h3>
            <h3>
				cipher page(s) - For each cipher you select, you must include an appropriately
				named html page that includes at least a description of the cipher, a text entry
				area for writing a message, and an area for displaying the enciphered version of
				the message. You will implement the selected cipher using JavaScript so that a
				message can be enciphered and deciphered.
            </h3>
            <h3>
				A simple place to start is with the Caesar Cipher. The Rot13 cipher, which we
				investigated in the labs is a special case of the Caesar Cipher which was used in
				Ancient Rome to encipher secret messages. You should find, research, and
				implement at least two different ciphers for your site.
